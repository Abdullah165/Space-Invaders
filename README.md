#Space Invaders with C++ and Raylib ðŸš€
A classic arcade-style recreation of Space Invaders, built to explore game development concepts with C++ and the Raylib library. Defend the Earth from waves of descending aliens!

âœ¨ Features
Player Control: Smooth left and right movement and laser firing.

Shooting Mechanics: Both the player and aliens can fire projectiles.

Collision Detection: Laser-on-alien and laser-on-player hit detection.

Lives: A simple system to track the player's remaining lives.

Sound Effects: Basic sounds for shooting, explosions, and alien movement.

ðŸ“š What I Learned
This project was a fantastic exercise in moving beyond single-entity games. Key takeaways include:

Object-Oriented Design: Structuring the game using classes for the Player, Alien, and Bullet to manage their individual state and behavior.

Managing Collections: Using vectors to handle a large number of game objects, such as the entire alien swarm and multiple on-screen bullets.

Group Movement Logic: Implementing the classic side-to-side, stepping-down movement pattern for the alien swarm as a single cohesive unit.

Timed Events & Cooldowns: Managing player fire rate and the aliens' random shooting intervals without halting the game loop.

Resource Management: Loading and unloading textures (sprites) and sound effects properly.

ðŸŽ® How to Play
Move: Use the A and D keys or the Left and Right Arrow keys to move your ship.

Shoot: Press the Spacebar to fire your bullets.
